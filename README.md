# Flutter Test

You will need to create one Flutter project with the following instruction. Please make sure to read the instruction carefully.

## Prerequisites

- An API key from [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io)
(please use this API key: kAHMK3303qDjYC5gzsKtpCA537NvQIaw )

## Scenario

- Please create one Android App using Flutter framework for cryptocurrency market watch list. You can clone this repo and start from there.
- The app itself will be a two-page app, first page listing all tokens sourced from the API above, and the second page for token watchlist (favorites list).
- It will show the 15 min delayed time price change from web socket. The only difference (with real time pricing) is all prices are shifted 15 minutes from real time.
- There should be a "favorite" function, which upon activated will re-sort the list, and put the favorite token(s) on top.
- Favorite page should have the function to manage the token watchlist.

## Rules

- Use Flutter framework (minimum version for dart is 2.16.2, and Flutter version 2.10.4)
- Use of state management solution is recommended
- Provide the repository link to your project, with the instruction to to build the application
- Provide the resulting .apk file, or
- If you decide to use cloud solution to host you application, make sure that it can still be accessed for the period of two weeks

## Assessment aspects

- Delayed time ("real time") aspect of the price change
- Application speed and stability
- Code cleanliness
- Abstraction layer
- Unit test and functional API test

## Information

The documentation for the API is [here](https://polygon.io/docs/crypto/getting-started)
